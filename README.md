# My To Do List App

## A to do list, built with Django where the user can do as follows:

- Create their own account
- Create their profile
- Create/Read/Update/Delete personal lists and tasks
- Update credentials
- Track amount of lists, uncompleted and completed tasks.

### What I Learnt

This project's main focus was to learn the Django framework, starting with the basics and then trying to do ever so slightly more advanced tasks!
As well as using bootstrap for the first time, which will explain the very "minimalistic" styling.

Here is what I've learn't:
- Using purely Bootstrap4 to style the pages
- Creating Django projects and apps
- How to use Django's views and url paths
- How to use DJango's template inheritance
- Creating "plugable" apps
- Connecting my Django project to an external database
- Django Model system
- OnetoOne, OnetoMany and Foreignkeys with models
- Extending the default models
- Using Signals with models
- How to deploy a Python/Django project on python anywhere
- How to use the basics of javascript service workers to create a PWA of the project

### A Few Steps Further

1- Since this was to understand Django I decided to go abit further and figure out how to deploy a django project, so I deployed and hosted this project on Pythonanywhere at this url:

    wwww.jsonhilder.pythonanywhere.com

2- To try add a little something extra to my project I decided to package it as a PWA to allow users to install it on their devices. It helped me understand and implement google's javascript service workers, one thing I need to work on is to utilize the caching and local browser storage with service workers to allow the project to be used offline, as currently it requires an internet connection.
